Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

## UNC Mobile App Dashboard Redesign - Usability Research Study

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UX Research Methods  
**Role:** Project Lead

**Overview:**  
Led a comprehensive usability study evaluating categorical versus flat grid navigation layouts for the My UNC Mobile App dashboard. Conducted a controlled within-subjects experiment with 15 undergraduate participants to test whether organizing campus tools into logical categories (Academics, Campus Life, Resources) improves navigation efficiency compared to the existing 13-icon flat grid.

**Key Results:**
- **28% faster** task completion (36.1s → 26.0s average)
- **67% reduction** in navigation errors (2.4 → 0.8 errors per session)
- **31% decrease** in cognitive workload (NASA-TLX: 55.7 → 38.3)
- Significant improvements in user confidence and clarity ratings
- All results statistically significant (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.0)

**Methods & Approach:**
- Designed and developed interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototypes
- Within-subjects experimental design with counterbalanced conditions
- NASA-TLX workload assessments
- Quantitative metrics: completion time, error rates
- Statistical analysis: paired t-tests, Cohen's d effect sizes
- Qualitative user feedback and debriefing sessions

**Design Principles Applied:**
- Gestalt Grouping (proximity and similarity)
- Recognition over recall
- Cognitive load reduction
- Fitts' Law for mobile interaction design
- Human-centered design methodology

**Outcome:**  
Delivered actionable UX recommendations supported by empirical evidence, demonstrating how theory-driven interface design can measurably improve mobile user experience for academic tools.

**Status:** Completed

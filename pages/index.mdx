# Daniel Garza

Hey, I'm a student at the University of Northern Colorado pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and Pure and Applied Mathematics! 
I am currently conducting research on IoT devices this summer and working in IT as a Business Analyst. 
In my free time, I like to code, learn languages, and lift heavy weights. 

はじめまして！很高兴认识你 !
